            <p>Because our vision for the future is making a difference for the animals and people of our communities,
                our long-term success is dependent upon education. It is often the children that drive progress and
                determine the future in our world.


                With that in mind, MVAS believes strongly in working relationships with schools, scout groups, clubs,
                civic groups, community organizations and anyone else willing to help us reach out to people - and
                especially young people - throughout Lake County.


                MVAS has opportunities for children and other groups to visit our facility, witness our life-saving
                work, be involved in our mission, learn about animals and get to meet some of our critters! We are also
                willing to make an off-site visit to your classroom, organization or event and discuss our work. We
                might even be able to visit with a cute animal in tow!</p>

        <div class="container">The Mission Valley Animal Shelter is available to help if you need to re-home your pet.


            Before you make the decision to do this, we ask you to consider that the best possible option for your pet
            (in most cases) is to stay in your home with your family. It is very stressful for an animal as well as its
            human family to separate. Animals are part of our family, and they certainly sense that emotionally.


            If you need assistance to help you keep your animal (behavioral modification support, advice on training,
            financial assistance, pet food or other supplies or anything else), we urge you to call us. We might be able
            to help. If we cannot help, we might be able to refer you to other helpful resources or support. If all of
            our options are exhausted, we will work with you to schedule a surrender.


            Surrenders will generally only be accepted on an appointment-basis. You need to call us ahead of time and
            tell us about the animal and your circumstances. We will set up a time for a check-in. Occasionally we will
            be full, in which case you may be placed on our wait list until we can call you when a kennel space becomes
            available.

            ​

            When you bring your dog or cat to Fox for surrender, we ask that you bring vet records and anything else
            that you feel may ease your pets's transition.


            There is no surrender fee at Fox, but we do encourage voluntary donations, because the care we provide to
            each animal is not cost-free.

        <div container>In Lake County, the Mission Valley Animal Shelter is the best place to call if you are missing your animal or you have found one.
 

            We maintain a database of lost and found cats and dogs, and we are always excited to facilitate reunions.
             
            
            When a lost dog enters our shelter as a stray, the first thing we do is scan the animal for a microchip.  If there is no chip found, our next step is to immediately post the found animal report on our website and on our Facebook page along with several facebook sites: Montana Pets, Polson Facebook Yardsale, Finding Bella Dog and Fetching Ted.
             
            
            We have a mandatory 10 business day stray-hold period, during which time owners can reclaim their dog or cat.  At the end of the tenth day, the dog or cat becomes our property and is placed up for adoption.
             
            
            There is a stray reclaim fee to be paid upon retrieving your animal:
             
            
            $100 if the animal was here longer than 24 hours at which point we vaccinate for the animals protection.
             
            
            These reclaim fees help us continue to provide services to the community and also reinforce the importance of keeping animals confined for their safety and the safety of the community at large.
